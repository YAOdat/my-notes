# Good Developer Mindset

- **The purpose of Software is** not to show off how smart you are, but it is **how helpful you are**.

- ``` javascript {
  var developer;
  var understand;
  if (var developer == understand) {
  console.log('easy code')}
  else {console.log('complicated code')}
  ```
 - ~~FOCUS ONLY ON THE PRESENT~~ THINK OF THE FUTURE
